## 📈 Model Comparison

Both MFCC and HuBERT representations were tested across models.  
Final best performing model: **HuBERT + BiLSTM**

| Feature Type | Model                   | Accuracy (%) | Notes                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| MFCC         | Random Forest           | 99.01        | Lightweight baseline                  |
| HuBERT       | BiLSTM                  | 99.50        | Best performance & generalization     |

## 🧪 Word-Level vs Sentence-Level Evaluation

| Category        | Accuracy (%) | Robustness Level | Interpretability |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Word-Level      | 99.45        | Medium           | Low              |
| Sentence-Level  | 99.77        | High             | High             |

> Insight: Accent patterns emerge more clearly in **continuous speech**, improving model confidence and interpretability.
